The following katas have been backported from [Mikado Method and Test Data Builders Kata](https://github.com/murex/mikado-testbuilders-kata) under the [MIT Licence](https://github.com/murex/mikado-testbuilders-kata/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

The tests include implementations to have a training focused on the usage of the mikado method, removing the code discovery needs.

Thanks to [Philippe Bourgau](https://github.com/philou) and [the whole team of contributors](https://github.com/murex/mikado-testbuilders-kata/graphs/contributors) for their work.
