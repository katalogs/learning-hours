# The Mikado method

## Preparation
- A tool to draw a mikado graph (eg: a miro board, Coggle, Xmind, Mindmup ..)
- An IDE with the kata you choose opened

## Learning Goals
- Explain the interest of using the mikado method to refactor legacy code
- List the steps to create a mikado graph

## Connect (5 min)
Three situations that happened when refactoring a legacy codebase.  *1 note per situation*

## Concepts (15 min)
- Introduce the mikado method and and its workflow.
- Make a demo using a kata (eg. [Mikado Method and Test Data Builders Kata](https://github.com/murex/mikado-testbuilders-kata)):
  - Mikado Goal: replace test inputs creation with Test Data Builders
  - Create a Test Data Builder for an Invoice
  - Solution for the next step: Create a Test Data Builder for a BookPurchase
  - Revert changes

## Concrete Practice (35 min)
- Use the previously found prerequisite as starting point for the team
- Make the team guide you in the next steps of implementation and draw the mikado graph

## Conclusion - Does our code have this issue? (5 min)
Ask people to discuss for 5 minutes about the question:
Do you have part of your codebase to refactor where you could apply the Mikado Method ?
