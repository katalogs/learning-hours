The sample project is an audit system that keeps track of all visitors in an organization.It uses flat text files as underlying storage with the structure shown in figure 6.11. Thesystem appends the visitorâ€™s name and the time of their visit to the end of the mostrecent file. When the maximum number of entries per file is reached, a new file withan incremented index is created.
